# OCTOPUS: Origin Centered Trauma Outreach Protection Under Survivor Sight

Mantra: Human first. Tech second.

Tag: Ara-Synced – Human Endpoint Pending  
Guardrail DNA: R4.2.3-FINAL (Frozen / PASS)  
Classification: Pilot Proposal Only — Not an Operational System

* * *

## What it is

A survivor-centered coordination model proposed for pilot evaluation to test whether response latency can be reduced in child and youth trafficking prevention without expanding surveillance, investigative authority, or enforcement powers.

AI (where used) synthesizes aggregate, non-identifiable patterns only for decision-support.  
Humans authorize all actions. No component operates autonomously.

## What it is not (binding constraints — Global Constraints List)

The following constraints are non-negotiable and define the operational boundaries of this framework:

  * ❌ No new investigative powers created
  * ❌ No bulk data ingestion
  * ❌ No biometric scraping
  * ❌ No facial recognition systems
  * ❌ No watchlists
  * ❌ No risk scoring of individuals
  * ❌ No individual profiling
  * ❌ No predictive arrest modeling
  * ❌ No predictive policing
  * ❌ No mass surveillance
  * ❌ No automated referral to law enforcement (human validation required for all escalations)
  * ❌ No automated enforcement action
  * ❌ No evidentiary media ingestion, storage, or management
  * ❌ No cross-linkage of intake streams by default
  * ❌ No monitoring of individuals or communities
  * ❌ No operational targeting
  * ❌ No autonomous execution — no alert, routing, escalation, or action occurs without documented human authorization

### Additional Explicit Prohibitions

  * ❌ No automated referrals to law enforcement without explicit, documented human validation
  * ❌ No creation or contribution to watchlists of any kind
  * ❌ No biometric scraping, facial recognition, or identity inference systems

Court orders or other lawful authority required where applicable.  
All escalation requires documented human authorization.  
Mandatory human-in-the-loop at every escalation point.

* * *

## Governance (required controls before any pilot deployment)

Before this framework can be operationalized—even in pilot form—the following controls must be in place:

### Privacy & Compliance

  * ✅ PIPEDA compliance and consent principles
  * ✅ Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) prior to deployment
  * ✅ Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) prior to deployment

### AI & Bias Controls

  * ✅ Bias testing on all training data
  * ✅ Explainability requirements for all model outputs
  * ✅ Independent audit review

### Human Oversight

  * ✅ Mandatory human-in-the-loop at all escalation points
  * ✅ Automation bias training for all human reviewers
  * ✅ Override rates must be audited
  * ✅ No performance metrics may incentivize deference to AI outputs

### Governance Board Composition

  * ✅ Legal counsel
  * ✅ Privacy officer
  * ✅ Child protection expert
  * ✅ Community representation
  * ✅ At least one independent member (not affiliated with participating agencies)
  * ✅ At least two voting seats reserved for survivors selected through independent survivor-led organizations

Material changes to Blueprint methodology or consent protocols require survivor-member approval.

### Policy Commitments

  * ✅ Explicit rejection of predictive policing
  * ✅ Explicit rejection of mass surveillance

* * *
