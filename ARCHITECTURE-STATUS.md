# Architecture Status — Framework Freeze

Version: v1.0  
Status: Frozen  
Classification: Pilot Proposal Only — Not Operational Infrastructure  

---

## Structural Integrity Check

The Octopus Framework currently includes:

- Survivor Blueprint Phase (Consent-Locked)
- Eight Restricted Integration Pathways
- Human-Reviewed Decision-Support Layer
- Governance Enforcement Files
- Hippocratic License 3.0
- Ethical Covenant Protections

No surveillance logic.
No predictive modeling.
No risk scoring.
No automated escalation.
No authority expansion.

---

## Drift Safeguards

The following elements are locked:

- Consent must remain revocable.
- Outputs must remain aggregate and non-identifiable.
- Outputs must remain non-persistent.
- Human authorization required at every escalation.
- Survivor veto authority preserved.

Any change to these elements requires:
- Survivor Board sign-off.
- Documented governance approval.
- Commit reference.

---

## Current Operational Status

This repository contains:

- Governance framework
- Ethical safeguards
- Licensing structure
- Documentation only

It does NOT contain:

- Live integrations
- Data ingestion systems
- Active AI models
- Operational deployment code

This is infrastructure blueprint stage only.

---

## Next Evolution Phase

Future phases (if approved) require:

- Independent legal review
- Privacy Impact Assessment
- Algorithmic Impact Assessment
- Survivor board formalization
- Institutional partnership agreements

No implementation occurs without governance completion.

Human first.
Tech second..
Authority does not expand...
