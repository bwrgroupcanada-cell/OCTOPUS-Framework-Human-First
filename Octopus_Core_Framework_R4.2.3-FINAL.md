Octopus: Origin Centered Trauma Outreach Protection Under Survivor Sight
Mantra: Human first. Tech second.
Origin = the victim story. Centered = human first. Trauma = the root. Outreach = tentacles. Protection = purpose. Under Survivor Sight = consent & ownership.

________________________________________
Executive Summary
Octopus is a survivor-centered coordination model proposed for pilot evaluation to test whether response latency can be reduced in child and youth trafficking prevention without expanding surveillance, investigative authority, or enforcement powers.
Octopus operates strictly within existing legal authority frameworks. It does not create new investigative powers, new data access privileges, or new enforcement mechanisms. It does not establish watchlists, assign risk scores, conduct biometric scraping, or enable predictive policing.
AI within Octopus synthesizes aggregate, non-identifiable patterns only. It does not determine culpability. It does not generate enforcement actions. It does not produce binding decisions. It does not automate referrals to law enforcement. All AI outputs are decision-support signals subject to mandatory human review.
All escalation pathways require documented human review, authorization, and accountability. No system component authorizes automated enforcement action.
Survivor Blueprints are explicitly consented, anonymized, non-identifiable, and revocable upon request. Survivor ownership remains intact at every stage. Consent is not presumed — it is documented, informed, and withdrawable.
Octopus is open-source, non-monetized, and governance-constrained. It is a coordination layer — not a surveillance tool, not a predictive policing engine, not an authority expansion, and not a replacement for frontline professionals, survivor support, or judicial process.
Human dignity overrides system efficiency. Human oversight overrides algorithmic output. Human consent overrides institutional speed.

1. Victim Blueprint Phase
Purpose
Establish survivor narratives as the structural foundation of Octopus — not as data points, but as the lived truth that every system constraint exists to protect.
Requirements
•	Minimum 10 consented Survivor Blueprints before any aggregate pattern analysis.
•	Explicit, informed, written consent — not blanket or assumed.
•	Full anonymization prior to any system intake.
•	Non-identifiable data structure throughout.
•	Revocable participation at any time, without penalty or loss of access to services.
•	Survivor ownership maintained — survivors are not subjects; they are the authority on their own experience.
Blueprint Structure
•	Origin conditions.
•	Trauma root factors.
•	Recruitment vector.
•	Missed intervention points.
•	Disclosure barriers.
•	Recovery friction.
•	System breakdown nodes.
Constraint
Blueprint analysis produces aggregate, non-identifiable patterns only. No identifiable fragments released under any circumstance. Mandatory re-identification risk assessment prior to release of any output derived from Blueprint data. Where assessment identifies residual risk, suppression or generalization is applied to ensure outputs meet the standard of non-identifiable information under applicable privacy law. Human-in-the-loop review required before any insight derived from Blueprints informs outreach planning, program design, or resource allocation. Blueprint data is not used for secondary purposes without additional consent or lawful authority. Survivor Blueprints may not be combined with external datasets for enrichment, validation, or triangulation purposes.

2. Octopus Architecture
Octopus operates through eight outreach tentacles. Each tentacle connects only to existing lawful systems and voluntary, written participation agreements. No tentacle operates independently of governance oversight. No tentacle creates new authority.
Tentacle 1 — School Reporting Logs
Aggregate trend indicators only. No individual profiling. No student-level tracking. Participation by educational institutions requires voluntary, written agreement specifying scope, purpose, and retention. Human-in-the-loop review required before any escalation.
Tentacle 2 — Community Signal Platforms (e.g., Life365 equivalents)
Event-based, aggregate signals only. Non-identifiable. Limited to platforms operating under voluntary, written participation agreements. No continuous monitoring of individuals or communities. Human-in-the-loop review required before any escalation.
Tentacle 3 — Emergency Service Clustering
De-identified recurrence patterns only. No individual case linkage outside existing lawful authority. Aggregate trend outputs subject to re-identification risk assessment prior to release. Human-in-the-loop review required before any escalation.
Tentacle 4 — Open-Forum Indicators
Publicly accessible content only — content visible to the general public without login, password, or special access credentials. No private-message access absent lawful authority. No access to encrypted messaging without warrant. Analysis limited to platforms that have entered into voluntary, written participation agreements with the pilot governance body. Event-based, aggregate signals for program-level prevention planning only — not operational targeting of specific individuals or communities. Human-in-the-loop review required before any escalation.
Tentacle 5 — CARE Unit Coordination
Within existing statutory mandates only. Coordination on existing cases within participating agencies' statutory mandates only. No expansion of mandate or jurisdiction. Written MOUs specifying purpose, data elements, access roles, retention, and audit controls. Any material expansion of a participating agency's statutory mandate triggers automatic suspension of access pending governance re-approval and updated Privacy Impact and Algorithmic Impact Assessments. Human-in-the-loop review required before any escalation.
Tentacle 6 — Youth Shelter & Housing Logs
Trend-level intake descriptors only. Non-identifiable. No individual tracking. Participation requires voluntary, written agreement. Consent-based intake only — no information extracted without informed, documented consent from participating organizations and, where applicable, individuals. Human-in-the-loop review required before any escalation.
Tentacle 7 — Community Hotline Intake
Separate anonymous and consent-based intake streams. No cross-linkage by default. Anonymous stream: accepts tips without collecting personal identifiers; used for general trend awareness only. Consent-based stream: collects limited personal information only with explicit notice and consent. Identifiable information is not used for secondary purposes without additional consent or lawful authority. Retention subject to predefined, time-limited operational window aligned to PIPEDA purpose limitation. Human-in-the-loop review required before any escalation.
Tentacle 8 — Interagency Sandbox Dashboards
Role-based access under written MOUs specifying purpose, permissible data elements, access roles, retention limits, and audit controls. For coordination on existing cases within participating agencies' statutory mandates only. Access is tiered, logged, and subject to periodic review. All information-sharing requires documented human authorization. Court orders or other lawful authority required where applicable. Human-in-the-loop review required before any escalation.
Global Constraints (All Tentacles)
•	No new investigative powers created.
•	No bulk data ingestion.
•	No biometric scraping.
•	No facial recognition systems.
•	No watchlists.
•	No risk scoring of individuals.
•	No predictive arrest modeling.
•	No predictive policing.
•	No mass surveillance.
•	No automated referral to law enforcement without human validation.
•	No automated enforcement action.
•	No evidentiary media ingestion, storage, or management.
•	No cross-linkage of intake streams by default.
•	No monitoring of individuals or communities.
•	No operational targeting.
•	Court orders or other lawful authority required where applicable.
•	All escalation requires documented human authorization.
•	Mandatory human-in-the-loop at every escalation point across every tentacle.
•	No autonomous execution: no alert, routing, escalation, or action occurs without documented human authorization.

3. Master Pulse Engine
Human-Reviewed Decision-Support Layer (AI suggests patterns. Humans decide actions.)
Function
Master Pulse Engine is not an autonomous engine. It is a human-reviewed coordination layer: AI synthesizes aggregate patterns; humans authorize all actions. Synthesize aggregate signals across tentacles and Survivor Blueprints into decision-support outputs for trained human review.
Output Type
•	Aggregate.
•	Non-identifiable.
•	Decision-support only.
•	Subject to re-identification risk assessment prior to release.

Prohibited
•	Individual risk scoring.
•	Individual profiling.
•	Autonomous action of any kind.
•	Enforcement triggers.
•	Predictive policing logic.
•	Predictive arrest modeling.
•	Binding determinations of culpability.
•	Automated referral to law enforcement.
Required Governance Controls
•	PIPEDA compliance and consent principles.
•	Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) prior to deployment.
•	Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) prior to deployment.
•	Bias testing on training data.
•	Explainability requirements for all model outputs.
•	Independent audit review.
•	Mandatory human-in-the-loop at all escalation points.
•	Human reviewers must receive documented training on automation bias; override rates must be audited; no performance metrics may incentivize deference to AI outputs.
•	Explicit rejection of predictive policing.
•	Explicit rejection of mass surveillance.
•	Governance board including legal, privacy, child protection, community representation, and at least one independent member not affiliated with participating agencies. At least two voting seats are reserved for survivors selected through independent survivor-led organizations; material changes to Blueprint methodology or consent protocols require survivor-member approval.
AI synthesizes patterns only. Aggregate outputs are non-persistent and may not be retained or combined across reporting cycles in a manner that enables longitudinal inference. Humans decide.

4. Open-Source Rollout & Ethics Guardrails
Licensing
Creative Commons release via GitHub. Non-commercial. No monetization.
Adoption Requirements
Any jurisdiction, organization, or entity adopting or adapting Octopus must independently complete:
•	Independent legal review confirming compliance with applicable law.
•	Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).
•	Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA).
•	Establishment of a governance board including legal, privacy, child protection, community representation, and at least one independent member not affiliated with participating agencies.
•	Execution of written participation agreements for all integrations, specifying purpose, data elements, access roles, retention, and audit controls. Participation agreements must be executed without coercion, penalty, or adverse consequence for non-participation, including as a condition of funding, licensure, or regulatory approval.
•	Demonstrated human-in-the-loop requirement at every escalation point.
Non-Expansion Clause
Octopus does not — and no adaptation of Octopus may:
•	Create investigative authority.
•	Expand jurisdiction.
•	Monitor individuals or communities.
•	Conduct biometric scraping.
•	Deploy facial recognition.
•	Build watchlists.
•	Assign risk scores to individuals.
•	Automate enforcement actions.
•	Automate referrals to law enforcement.
•	Enable predictive policing.
•	Enable mass surveillance.
•	Replace professional judgment.
•	Ingest, store, or manage evidentiary media.
•	Access private communications absent lawful authority.
•	Access encrypted messaging without warrant.
Open-source publication does not grant operational authority. Adoption without independent governance review, legal review, and privacy assessment is a violation of the framework's design intent.

Constraint Integrity Confirmation
Octopus creates no new authority.
No investigative powers. No enforcement mechanisms. No data access privileges beyond what existing law and voluntary, written agreements provide. No expansion of jurisdiction, mandate, or surveillance capacity.
Octopus is a coordination layer only.
It connects existing lawful systems under governance oversight. It does not replace frontline professionals, survivor support services, or judicial process. It does not operate autonomously.
AI synthesizes patterns only.
Aggregate. Non-identifiable. Decision-support. Subject to re-identification risk assessment. Subject to mandatory bias testing, explainability review, and independent audit. No individual profiling. No risk scoring. No predictive policing. No automated enforcement.

Humans decide.
Every escalation, every referral, every priority designation, every information-sharing action requires documented human review, authorization, and accountability. No system component acts without a human being accountable for the decision.
Survivor consent is revocable.
Participation is voluntary, informed, written, and withdrawable at any time without penalty or loss of access to services. Survivors are not data sources — they are the human beings this framework exists to protect.
Human dignity overrides system efficiency. Human oversight overrides algorithmic output. Human consent overrides institutional speed.
